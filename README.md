The application is named Currency Converter for CS50x 2022 and simply put, it takes an input value as the amount which is to be converted and converts it from one form of currency to another, based on the user's choice. The user can change the amount they want to check the conversion rates for, anytime. The currencies can also be inverted with the help of a button by which one can check conversion rates the other way round.

As the web application fetches live exchange rates from a website - <https://www.exchangerate-api.com/> - using API, the user needs to be connected to the internet for this application to work. Once the user disconnects from the internet, the application no longer works. Instead, it displays a warning message saying 'Check your internet connection'.

## About CS50:
CS50 (Computer Science 50) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an Advanced Placement Computer Science course. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular hackathons.

The course material is available online for free on the EdX platform, with a range of certificates available for a fee. As of 2022, this online version, called CS50x, teaches the programming languages C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also teaches fundamental computer-science concepts including arrays and data structures, and the Flask web framework. The 2021 iteration of the course introduced three new additional lectures on computer security, artificial Intelligence, and the ethics of technology.

The lead instructor is Harvard professor David Malan. Brian Yu is also a former member of CS50 and was one of the lecturers. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and former Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer have given guest lectures.

Several follow-on programs exist, focusing on web programming, artificial intelligence, game development, and mobile apps.

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.
